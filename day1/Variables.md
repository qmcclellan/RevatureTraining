## **Variables**

Variables are essentially named containers for some piece of information.

Most programming languages allow you to create these named containers, assign them some value, and then use their name whenever you want that value.

Sometimes we can even alter what's stored in our named container and then for the rest of the program wherever we have the name of our variable it will reflect the new value.

Imagine for a second you have the following template for an email.

Dear *SoAndSo*, 

Thank you so much for everything. I really learned a lot.

Best,

Here you probably recognize that SoAndSo is just a placeholder for the name of your recipient.

You would know to delete the name and type the correct value here.

Variables work in much the same way; though, it's the program itself replacing the name with the value when the instructions that make up the program actually run.

You can simply use the variable name throughout your code wherever you need its value. (With limitations not all variables are usuable everywhere in a program.)

Though variables get created and named in different ways, you might have something similar to:

myFavoriteColor = "Orange"

Here the name of the variable is myFavoriteColor and the value is "Orange".

In most programming languages the variable has a name, a value, and a type or datatype. Though sometimes it might not be clearly defined what the type is.

If we continue with the example above. We specified the name and value. The datatype might be text or string. (Our guess at the datatype comes from the fact that Orange is in quotes.)

The specifics for defining our variable, its datatype, and its value would only become clear after deciding on the programming language used.
