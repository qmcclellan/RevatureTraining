## Data Types
**Datatypes**
When you go to describe a person, event, thing, or idea, there is all kinds of information you might use.

And the type of information is as valuable as the information itself.

Let's imagine for a minute that you receive the following as a text from your friend:

You might assume your friend was being hacked or had lost all sense of how to properly communicate.

Either way you would have no context for what type of information you're receiving (beyond potentially understanding that because they used digits the value is a number). If instead your friend said

Or even just

You might still not understand why your friend was sending you this information, but you would at least understand what the information was.

A datatype is just what it sounds like; it describes the kind or type of a piece of information.

You could argue that Phone Number is the datatype of 1234567890.

Typically a programming language starts off with some really basic datatypes and then sometimes has the ability to define more complex datatypes from there.

A language might begin with the types number, text, boolean(True/False) and then build to allow for a Collection of Numbers, or a datatype with a text portion and a number portion. How these different types are defined is going to be specific to the language itself.

In addition to this, each programming language will have its own way of recognizing different datatypes. Just like with the text example, simply by formatting the number as (123)-456-7890, we could understand that the information was a phone number.

A program might understand values surrounded in quotation marks are of a text datatype. Or digits might be recognized by a program as numbers. Or some words might be special keywords that are automatically understood i.e. true and false. The exact rules or syntax will depend on the programming language which you are dealing with.

** Though in just about all of them phone number would be a very unusual datatype to have built in.
