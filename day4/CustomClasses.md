## **Lab: Writing Your Own Classes**

**Writing Custom Classes**
Objectives
Learn the basics of writing custom Java classes.
Background
A class serves as a blueprint for an object, which is a 'living' instance of the class.

To create a class, you would use the class keyword followed by a unique name for the class as follows:

    class ClassName {

     //functionality here
    }
Many IDEs generate classes as public to avoid restrictions on usage. The keyword public is an access modifier and is beyond the scope of this article. Later in the lesson, when you generate the class, you should retain that modifier.

In object-oriented programming we define classes to track state and model behavior. Typically we try to create a model of a real-world object or scenario by defining classes.

**Guided Practice**
In this activity, we'll guide you through modeling a generic toy ball.

**Project Setup**
Open your IDE (Eclipse), and select File > New > Java Project. 

Provide the name, Lab-Classes and click OK. 

(Select "Don't Create" if a window comes up asking to "Create a module-info.java" file.)

Right-click on the newly created project and select New > Class. 

Provide the class the name, Ball and click Finish. Your class should look like the following:

    public class Ball {

    }
With the above, we have a basic class set up, but it doesn't do anything.

We need to add state and behavior, but before we do, let's create a couple of Ball objects.

**Creating Instances**
To create an instance of a class, you simply use the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor.

In the case of our Ball class, we can create an instance as follows:

new Ball();
This will create a new instance of a Ball; an object. The above code isn't very useful, however, as we need to keep track of a reference to the object. Thus, we need to assign a new variable to our object.

In this case we'll create a new reference variable.

Ball b1 = new Ball();
A reference variable is very similar to how you create a primitive variable. The only difference is that reference variables always refer to objects (instances of classes) whereas primitive variables refer to only primitives.

The same rules as when naming primitive variables apply to naming reference variables.

Let's create a main() method and declare a couple of reference variables to new instances.

Your code should look like the following:

public class Ball {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Ball b1 = new Ball();
        Ball b2 = new Ball();
    }
}
The next thing we need to do is define some state for our Ball class.

Defining State
Since we are modeling a toy ball, let's think of some properties that a real ball has. Perhaps we want to track the size and color of a ball in our model. We can declare some variables to track those properties.

Keeping it simple, let's declare an String variable named size and a String variable named color to track the size and color of a ball.

Your code should look like the following:

public class Ball {
    String size;
    String color;

    ...
}
It is a convention to define any properties at the top of the class and any methods below that.

Let's update our code (with comments added) in main() to provide initial values for the two Ball instances.

public class Ball {
    String size;
    String color;

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Ball b1 = new Ball();
        Ball b2 = new Ball();

        //declare initial state
        b1.size = "big";
        b1.color = "red";
        b2.size = "small";
        b2.color = "blue";
    }
}
Now our Ball class can keep track of its size and color. Next, we'll add some behavior.

Defining Behavior
Behavior typically deals with an action of some sort. Perhaps in our model, we should represent how a toy ball can bounce. With this thought, we'll define a method to reflect this action that a ball can take.

A method is a group of code that can be executed by its label or name. Creating methods is beyond the scope of this lesson. It will be sufficient to simply know what a method is.

We can keep our method simple. Copy the following into your class file just above the main method.

public void bounce(){
    System.out.println("The " + size + " " + color + " ball is bouncing.");
}
This method displays a String to the console that prints the size and color of a ball. It arbitrarily says it is "bouncing" as well.

Your code should now look like the following:

public class Ball {
    String size;
    String color;

    public void bounce(){
        System.out.println("The " + size + " " + color + " ball is bouncing.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Ball b1 = new Ball();
        Ball b2 = new Ball();

        //assign initial state to the Ball instances
        b1.size = "big";
        b1.color = "red";
        b2.size = "small";
        b2.color = "blue";
    }
}
Invoking Behavior
Lastly, add a couple of lines to invoke the method using the two reference variables. To invoke a method, you can use the dot operator with a reference variable.

To invoke the bounce() method, you can use the following code:

b1.bounce();
b2.bounce();
Add the above lines to your class inside of the main() method. Your class file should now look like the following (comments added):

public class Ball {
    String size;
    String color;

    public void bounce(){
        System.out.println("The " + size + " " + color + " ball is bouncing.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Ball b1 = new Ball();
        Ball b2 = new Ball();

        //assign initial state to the Ball instances
        b1.size = "big";
        b1.color = "red";
        b2.size = "small";
        b2.color = "blue";
        
        //invoke the bounce method
        b1.bounce();
        b2.bounce();
    }
}
Run the code and you'll see that each Ball instance correctly prints its state (size and color) by running the method bounce().



To recap, we've done a few things here.

We started by conceptualizing what a toy ball is and identified properties (size and color) and behavior (bounce) of a real-world ball.

We then created a Ball class to model this toy ball:

We defined two String properties, size and color, as part of the state to track for a Ball.
We defined behavior by using a single method called "bounce".
Within main()
we used the new keyword to create instances of a Ball.
we created two separate instances of the Ball class
assigned values to their properties
invoked their behavior by calling the bounce() method
We define programs to model real-world scenarios using objects. Within an object, you can track state and execute behavior by using the defined properties and methods.
