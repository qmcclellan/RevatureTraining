## **Lab: Writing Composite Classes**

**Writing Composite Classes**

Background
A class can declare another as an instance variable and this creates a composite relationship between the two.

For example, say you have the following class

    public class ClassA{
        String name = “name”;
    }

    public class ClassB {
       ClassA classA;  //declare an instance variable of type ClassA
    }
In the above code, we have two classes, ClassA and ClassB. ClassB has a composite relationship with ClassA.

**Guided Practice**
Now that we have some background on composite relationships we'll walk through creating classes that interact with one another.

Follow the instructions below to set up a new project. 

**Project Setup**
Open your IDE (Eclipse), and select File > New > Java Project.

Provide the name, Lab-CompositeRelationships and click OK.

Right-click on the newly created project and select New > Class.

Provide the class the name, ClassA and click OK.

Now edit the file so that it looks like the following:

    public class ClassA {

        String name = “name”;

     public void setName(String name){ this.name = name; }

     public String getName() {return name; }
    }
Excellent, now create another class, ClassB and edit the file so that it declares ClassA as an instance variable.

    public class ClassB {
     ClassA classA = new ClassA();
    }
Now, create a main method in ClassB.  

In the main method instantiate a new ClassB object.

    public class ClassB{

      ClassA classA = new ClassA();

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          ClassB b = new ClassB();
      }
    }
Since ClassB has a reference to ClassA, we can use the instance of ClassB to execute accessible methods from ClassA.

Next, use the reference variable b and the dot-operator to access its reference to ClassA and call the setName and getName methods.

    public class ClassB{

     ClassA classA = new ClassA();

     public static void main(String[] args) {
            ClassB b = new ClassB();
            b.classA.setName("Taylor");
    
            System.out.println(b.classA.getName());
        }
    }
Save the file and run the program.

You’ll output like the following.



This concludes the lab.
