## Lab 1: Print Your Name
Print Your Name
Instructions
Now that you know how to write a simple program to print, "Hello World", we will modify the program to print your name. 

1. Open your IDE (Eclipse). On first startup, Eclipse will ask for your default workspace. Go ahead and click on the checkbox that reads "Use this as the default and do not ask again". Then click Launch. 

eclipse launcher dialog

When Eclipse loads, it'll show a workspace like the following image:

Eclipse Dashboard

To start a new project, you'll need to locate the top menu bar. Then select File > New > Java Project. 

Eclipse - Menu Bar - File New Java Project

Provide the name, NameConsole and click Finish.

Eclipse Project Name

If Eclipse asks you to create a module, go ahead and click on Don't Create. We won't use modules in this course. 

Eclipse dialog - create module

Once the project loads, right-click on the newly created project and select New > Class.

Eclipse - Create class

Provide the class the name, MyClass and click Finish.

Eclipse New Java Class dialog

Now edit the file so that it looks like the following:

    public class MyClass {

     public static void main(String[] args){
             System.out.println("My Name");
        }
    }
Replace the words, *"My Name"* with your actual name.

Eclipse - Edited Class

Now run the program and note the output! It should display your name on the console!

Eclipse Run Button

If Eclipse asks which way to run the program, then select Java Application. 

Eclipse run as java application

The console should display in Eclipse and show the information that you added to print. 

Eclipse Console Output

That's all there is to writing and running small Java programs in Eclipse!

This concludes the lab.
