Lab: String Concatenation
String Concatenation
Background
In this exercise, you'll practice string concatenation. Concatenation is the process of combining two strings together using the + (plus) operator. You'll often see string concatenation when printing the output of a variable along with a sentence.

For example, say you have the following code snippet:

int x = 2;
String s = "The value of x is " + x;
The value of s after this snippet executes is, "The value of x is 2". What happens internally is the value of x is converted into a String and its value is combined with the value of the string "The value of x is ".

Notice we left a space after "is" so that the value of s would not be "The value of x is2".

Each primitive datatype can be easily embedded into the middle of a string as well.

Review the following snippet:

int y = 4;
String s = "The number " + y + " is an even number";
When executed, the value of s will be, "The number 4 is an even number".

Guided Practice
The following instructions will walk you through creating a simple project that uses string concatenation. 

Project Setup
Open your IDE (Eclipse), and select File > New > Java Project.
Provide the name, Lab-StringConcatenation and click Finish. a. If a module dialog appears, click Don't Create.
Right-click on the newly created project and select New > Class.
Provide the class the name, StringConcatenation and click Finish.
Now edit the file so that it looks like the following:
public class StringConcatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String beginning = "Hello";

        String end = " World";
        String combo = beginning + end;

        System.out.println(combo);
    }
}
In the program above we define two String variables and then combine then into a third one by using the + operator.

Run this program and you'll see that the full value "Hello World" prints to the console.



Adding a Primitive to a String
Next we'll create a variable of type long concatenate it to a string and print the result to the console. Edit the StringConcatenation class to define a long with a value of 203L and then print the phrase: "The value of l: l" by using concatenation and replacing 'l' with the value of the variable l.

Your solution should look like the following:

public class StringConcatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String beginning = "Hello";
        String end = " World";
        String combo = beginning + end;

        System.out.println(combo);
        
        long l = 203L;
        System.out.println("The value of l: " + l);
    }
}
Run the program and you'll see the output of your variable included with the string.



Adding Primitives to the Beginning of a String
You can also add a primitive to the beginning of a String or to the middle.

Create a new variable b of type boolean and set its value to true. The print the phrase "b is true" but use concatenation to replace 'b' with the value of variable b.

Your solution should resemble the following:

public class StringConcatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String beginning = "Hello";
        String end = " World";
        String combo = beginning + end;

        System.out.println(combo);

        long l = 203L;
        System.out.println("The value of l: " + l);

        boolean b = true;
        System.out.println(b + " is true");
    }
}
Run the program and you'll see the output of our value concatenated with the String that we created in the method.



Order Matters
So let's try and really stretch concatenation and see what the program will do when we try to have three operands and two are numbers.

Define two additional int variables x and y and assign values of 2 and 3, respectively. Then print them using the statement:

System.out.println("The sum of x and y is " + x + y);
Your solution should look like the following:

public class StringConcatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String beginning = "Hello";
        String end = " World";
        String combo = beginning + end;

        System.out.println(combo);

        long l = 203L;
        System.out.println("The value of l: " + l);

        boolean b = true;
        System.out.println(b + " is true");

        int x = 2;
        int y = 3;
        System.out.println("The sum of x and y is " + x + y);
    }
}
In the above code, we have added x and y to the string value. What do you think will be the output?

Run the program.

You'll see that the numbers are not added together but simply appended to the string.



Changing Order
We can easily change the precedence of the operators by using an extra set of parenthesis.

Edit the file to use parenthesis so that x + y should be is executed first and then appended to the string.

Your solution should look like the following:

public class StringConcatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String beginning = "Hello";
        String end = " World";
        String combo = beginning + end;

        System.out.println(combo);

        long l = 203L;
        System.out.println("The value of l: " + l);

        boolean b = true;
        System.out.println(b + " is true");

        int x = 2;
        int y = 3;
        System.out.println("The sum of x and y is " + (x + y));
    }
}
Run the program and you'll see that we get the output of the sum of the numbers.



Changing Order by Position
What would happen if we switched the order of the operands and placed the operation of x + y before the string?

We'll replace the previous print statement with:

System.out.println(x + y + " is the sum of x and y");
Edit the file to resemble the following:

    public class StringConcatenation {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
         String beginning = "Hello";
         String end = " World";
         String combo = beginning + end;

          System.out.println(combo);

         long l = 203L;
            System.out.println("The value of l: " + l);

         boolean b = true;
         System.out.println(b + " is true");

         int x = 2;
            int y = 3;
            System.out.println(x + y + " is the sum of x and y");
        }
    }
Do you think the number 23 or 5 will display with the rest of the sentence?

Run the program and you'll find the output be the sum of the numbers and not a string concatenation of 2 and 3.



One key point to remember here is that order matters when evaluating the + operator to determine if a statement is String concatenation statement or a mathematical sum. An easy rule of thumb is that whatever is on the left-hand side of the + operator determines whether it will be concatenation or a sum.

If the value on the left-hand side is a String, then the operation is a String concatenation and the resultant value will be a String. If, however, the operand is a number (short, int, double, etc.), then the two will produce a mathematical sum.

This concludes the lab.
